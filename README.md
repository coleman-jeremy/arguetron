# Arguetron

This is the first program I ever built. Arguetron is a Python-based interactive program that displays a humorous, animated robot background and responds to user input with random, snarky replies. It is built using PyQt5 for the graphical interface.

## Features

- Animated GIF background featuring an "angry robot".
- Interactive input where users can type questions or statements.
- Random snarky responses to user input.
- Responsive UI that resizes with the window.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyQt5

    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv .venv
